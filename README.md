1. Download [latest](https://github.com/Romanitho/Winget-Install-GUI/releases/latest) `WiGui.exe` and run (Or Run `Winget-Install-GUI.ps1` from sources directly, as WiGui.exe is not signed and can be untrusted from antivirus)
2. Search for an app, select your app in the droplist and submit it to the list. You can remove an app if wrong one submited.
3. Once the list is complete, click "Install" to launch the installations or "Save list to File" if you want to create app list that can be used with WAU for example
4. Optionally, you can install WAU in the same time (with default configuration at the moment).

All In One GUI :)
